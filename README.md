# Docker Runner - Docker Integration for VSC

Please note this is an early alpha version, so it may have bugs and missing features.
However I think it can be already very useful.
I am still experimenting a lot and I am planning to add much more features in the future. 

## How to start?

Press **Alt+Ctrl+D** to activate.

## What this extension can do for you now?

- Search and pull Docker images from Docker Hub
- Easily manage local images
- Manage local containers
- Easily copy files between local filesystem and container file system
- Pin your favourite containers to the main menu

## What are my plans for the future?

TBD
